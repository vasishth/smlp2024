     <h3>Brief history of the summer school, and motivation</h3>

The summer school was started by Shravan Vasishth in 2017, as part of a <a
href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/sfb1287/projects/infrastructure-service-training-and-central-projects/project-q.html">methods
project</a> funded within the <a
href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/sfb1287/index.html">SFB 1287</a>. The summer
school aims to fill a gap in statistics education, specifically within the
fields of linguistics and psychology. One goal of the summer school is to
provide comprehensive training in the theory and application of statistics, with
a special focus on the linear mixed model.  Another major goal is to make
Bayesian data analysis a standard part of the toolkit for the linguistics and
psychology researcher. Over time, the summer school has evolved to have at least
four parallel streams: foundational and advanced courses in frequentist and
Bayesian statistics. These may be expanded to more parallel sessions in future
editions. We typically admit a total of 120 participants (in 2019, we had some
450 applications). In addition to the all-day courses, we regularly invite
speakers to give lectures on important current issues relating to statistics.

        Title: A United Discipline: Hierarchical Modeling of Individual
        Differences in Cognitive Experiments<br>

        In his 1957 presidential address to the American Psychological
        Association, Lee Cronbach famously described psychology as two distinct
        disciplines: One concerned primarily with the experimental method and
        one concerned primarily with the correlational method. Cronbach proposed
        that these two disciplines be merged, promising more coherent theory,
        methodology, and practical recommendations. In my talk, I will review
        efforts at "Cronbach's merger" over the past 25 years in the field of
        attentional control, where researchers attempt to study individual
        differences using experiments. I will discuss issues of the merger from
        both the correlational and experimental sides, focusing on the
        reliability and validity of attentional control experiments. Throughout,
        I will highlight how hierarchical modeling as a statistical tool and
        cognitive modeling as a theoretical tool may (or may not) help to
        address some of these issues.

     <h3>Courses</h3>

     <ul>

     <li><strong>Introduction to Bayesian data analysis</strong> (maximum 30 participants). Taught by Shravan Vasishth,  and <a href="https://annlaurin.github.io/">Anna Laurinavichyute</a>.</li>

<br>
     <strong>You can decide whether this course is appropriate for you by looking at the online version
     of this course (videos are available): <a href="https://open.hpi.de/courses/bayesian-statistics2023">see here</a></strong>.
     <br><br>
     This course is an introduction to Bayesian modeling, oriented towards linguists and
     psychologists.  Topics to be covered: Introduction to Bayesian data analysis,
     Linear Modeling, Hierarchical Models. We will cover these topics within
     the context of an applied Bayesian workflow that includes exploratory data
     analysis, model fitting, and model checking using simulation.<br>

     <strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Participants
     are expected to be familiar with frequentist methodology (what is taught in
     the foundations course, see below, as well as this online textbook:
     <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/Freq_CogSci/">here</a>), be relatively fluent in R usage, and <strong>must</strong>
     have some experience in data analysis, particularly with the R library lme4.
     Basic high school (pre-calculus) arithmetic and mathematical fluency is
     assumed; for example, you should know what a log is, what an exponent is,
     and be able to solve for y in x=log(y/(1-y)). If you are unfamiliar with frequentist
     methods, we suggest taking the introductory frequentist course listed below.
     <br>


     <strong>Course Materials</strong>

     Textbook: <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/">here</a>. We will work through the first six chapters, plus the chapter
     on Bayes factors.<br>

     <br><br>
     <li><strong>Advanced Bayesian data analysis</strong> (maximum 30 participants). Taught by <a href="https://bnicenboim.github.io/">Bruno Nicenboim</a> and <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/himanshuyadavjnu/">Himanshu Yadav</a></li>

<br>

     This course assumes that participants have some experience in Bayesian modeling already using brms and want to transition to Stan to learn more advanced methods and start building simple computational cognitive models. Participants should have worked through or be familiar with the material in the first five chapters of our book draft: <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/Bayes_CogSci/">Introduction to Bayesian Data Analysis for Cognitive Science</a>. In this course, we will cover Parts III to V of our book draft: model comparison using Bayes factors and k-fold cross validation, introduction and relatively advanced models with Stan, and simple computational cognitive models.
     <br>

     <strong>Course Materials</strong>

     Textbook <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/bayescogsci/">here</a>. We will start from Part III of the book (Advanced models with Stan). Participants are expected to be familiar with the first five chapters.<br><br>

     <li><strong>Foundational methods in frequentist statistics</strong> (maximum 30 participants). Taught by <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/ling/staff-list/audreybuerki">Audrey Buerki</a>,  <a href="https://www.health-and-medical-university.de/universitaet/unser-team/team-fakultaet-gesundheit/professoren/prof-dr-daniel-schad-hmu-potsdam/">Daniel Schad</a>, and <a href="https://www.jverissimo.net/">João Veríssimo</a>.</li>


<br>
     Participants will be expected to have used linear mixed models before, to the level of the textbook by <a href="http://www.bodowinter.com/blog/book-release-statistics-for-linguists">Winter (2019, Statistics for Linguists)</a>, and want to acquire a deeper knowledge of frequentist foundations, and understand the linear mixed modeling framework more deeply. Participants are also expected to have fit multiple regressions. We will cover model selection, contrast coding, with a heavy emphasis on simulations to compute power and to understand what the model implies. We will work on (at least some of) the participants' own datasets. <i>This course is not appropriate for researchers new to R or to frequentist statistics</i>.<br>

     <strong>Course Materials</strong>

     Textbook draft <a href="https://vasishth.github.io/Freq_CogSci/">here</a>.
     <br><br>

     <li><strong>Advanced methods in frequentist statistics with Julia</strong> (maximum 30 participants). Taught by  <a href="https://www.uni-potsdam.de/en/trainingswissenschaft/staff/rkliegl.html">Reinhold Kliegl</a>, <a href="https://phillipalday.com/">Phillip Alday</a>, and <a href="https://stat.wisc.edu/staff/bates-douglas/">Doug Bates</a>. </li>
     <br>

     Applicants must have experience with linear mixed models and be interested
     in learning how to carry out such analyses with the <a
     href="https://github.com/JuliaStats/MixedModels.jl">Julia-based
     MixedModels.jl package</a>) (i.e., the analogue of the R-based lme4
     package). MixedModels.jl has some significant advantages stemming from a
     faster implementation incorporating several algorithmic advances. The speed
     improvements make it easier to fit larger and more complex models as well
     as perform the repetitive model fitting necessary for power simulation and
     bootstrapping.</br>

     <br>We <strong>do not expect</strong> profound knowledge of Julia from
     participants; the necessary subset of knowledge will be taught on the first
     day of the course. We do expect a readiness to <a
     href="https://julialang.org/downloads/">install Julia</a> and the
     confidence that with some basic instruction participants will be able to
     adapt prepared Julia scripts for their own data or to adapt some of their
     own lme4-commands to the equivalent MixedModels.jl-commands.  There is good
     interoperability between R and Julia (with <a
     href="https://juliainterop.github.io/RCall.jl/stable/">RCall</a> on the
     Julia side and <a
     href="https://non-contradiction.github.io/JuliaCall/index.html">JuliaCall</a>
     on the R side) so that users can continue using R as necessary for e.g.
     data wrangling and plotting. <br><br>

<h3>Fees and accommodation</h3>

The summer school is free. Participants who are accepted are expected to arrange
their own accommodation. We strongly advise participants to find a place to stay
near Griebnitzsee campus, and not in Berlin. The reason is that German train
personnel tend to go on strike every year around the time of the summer school.
You will be better off if you can get easily to the Griebnitzsee campus.
